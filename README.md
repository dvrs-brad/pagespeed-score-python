# Website Maintenance Automation
This project is in the early stages of development.  When completed, it will allow you to automatically audit a list of managed websites for common maintenance tasks.  The results of each task will be reported back to a dashboard program.  The dashboard can be displayed on a monitor for easy visibility of website health.
